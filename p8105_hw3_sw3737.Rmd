## Problem 2

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

# Data import
```{r}
library(p8105.datasets)
data("brfss_smart2010")
```

# Data cleaning
```{r}
brfss_clean <- brfss_smart2010 %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  filter(topic == "Overall Health", 
         response %in% c("Excellent", "Very good", "Good", "Fair", "Poor")) %>% 
  mutate(response = factor(response, levels = c("Poor", "Fair", "Good", "Very good", "Excellent")))
```

# State analysis for 2002 and 2010
```{r}
brfss_clean %>%
  group_by(year, locationabbr) %>%
  summarise(counties = n_distinct(locationdesc)) %>%
  filter((year == 2002 | year == 2010) & counties >= 7)
```
In 2002, 6 states were observed at 7 or more locations (CT, FL, MA, NC, NJ, PA).
In 2010, 14 states were observed at 7 or more locations (CA, CO, FL, MA, MD, NC, NE, NJ, NY, OH, PA, SC, TX, WA).

# Construct a dataset
```{r}
excellent_data <- brfss_clean %>% 
  filter(response == "Excellent") %>%
  group_by(year, locationabbr) %>%
  summarise(avg_data_value = mean(data_value, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop")

ggplot(excellent_data, aes(x = year, y = avg_data_value, group = locationabbr, color = locationabbr)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Average Value of 'Excellent' Responses Over Time by State",
       x = "Year", y = "Average Value") +
  theme_minimal() 
```
